Why Portunus?
================

You should only need to use one system to manage your organizations access.

Access Management is a corner-stone of digital security in an age where digital security has never been more crucial.
So it is important to ensure that Access Management is enforced quickly and accurately;

* Not only on a handful of servers in a local office, but across global deployments of high-availability infrastructure.
* Not only on centralized directories like ActiveDirectory, but on everything from proprietary legacy systems, to cloud, to physical access.

Portunus has been designed from the ground up to support these needs in a modern diverse technical landscape that is rapidly evolving.

Key Features
------------

So fast, it's different
    Physical mail, then e-mail, then instant-messaging; a difference in speed can be so substantial that it creates potential.

    Portunus is designed to collect and process access-data **reactively and in real-time**.
    As soon as provisioning an account or a membership is complete, a collection is scheduled/performed/processed in seconds.

    This change in speed provides potential and drives novel functionality. Don't just make auditors happy, make employees happy.
Tailor to your needs
    Companies, infrastructure and requirements are all different; from the scale they function at to reliance on decades-old (and still rock-solid) mainframes.

    No IAM solution can truly support all access management needs without supporting customization.
    Portunus encourages integrating custom code to properly suit your unique needs, from Agent-interfaces for your mainframes to arbitrary business-tasks.
Secure
    With the ever growing attention on password management, Portunus integrates with trusted vault solutions (Hashicorp Vault) to safely and securely handle secrets.
    Even supporting seamless and fast password rotation across all infrastructure.

    Communications to Agents are also encrypted using per-Agent assymetric keypair encryption before being sent through TLS 1.3 secured channels.
Completely scalable
    Businesses scale as does their infrastructure.
    Portunus is designed from the ground-up so it can scale as needed to meet demand, without a bottleneck.
DR/HA Comprehension and Support
    Portunus is scalable and supports DR/HA (Disaster Recovery/High availability) deployments, even supporting infrastructure deployed across the globe.

    Not only that, but Portunus understands external DR environments; for example, replicated databases or redundant deployments of Unix servers.
Host identification built-in
    Many industry leading RBAC IAM solutions require host identification/discovery from third party tools.
    Portunus includes host identification out-of-the-box.
RESTful API
    Built with automation and machine driven processes in mind, Portunus is accessable to other services via the RESTFUL API which can be used to interact
    with all system functions such as provisioning, collections, host ID and user updates.

    When the REST API and custom business-tasks are combined, complete integration with nearly any service is possible.
