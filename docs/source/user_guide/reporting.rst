Reporting & Analytics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|


Reporting is built-in to Portunus allowing reports to be created, saved, and even executed periodically. Reports provide an overview of the data in the Portunus instance, which helps the organization manage system access and the compliance process. Out of the box, Portunus includes a 
set of core reports which will be available to the organisation to run adhoc or on a scheduled basis to get a better scope of access related data.

In addition, the REST API offers any more complex analysis to be built through external systems.
